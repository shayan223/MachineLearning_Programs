This Repo is filled with work regarding different machine learning algorithm implementations.

Most of these were tested on the MNIST data set which should be available seperately in this repo
within the DataSets folder.

The data set zip files should be labled with the names of their coresponding programs,
to use them, you should simply be able to drag the dataset into the corresponding
project folder and run the script.
